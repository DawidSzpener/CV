Few years ago I decided to take a huge gample and leave university to find something in life that will make me feel fulfilled.
I thought making alot of money and starting a new business would do, that was until my friend showed me his website and introduced me to coding.
That feeling when you finish some piece of code you have been strugling with for hours is one of a kind!
I realized its really fun and something I like doing while it also opens up alot of perspectives for the future.
So I took another gample leaving my comfy job and joining The Makers Academy to see if its truly for me.

## Skills

#### Humble
There is not a single person who knows everything the best, in a way even someone who is wrong could be right from different perspective.
I understand every opinion can be helpful and every persons perspective is unique in a way.
We learn more while listening than speaking.

#### Friendly and helpful
Helping others is something that really makes me happy and I always treat it like its not a big deal, becouse why should it be?
It already takes alot of courage to admit in front of someone else that you dont know or that you cant.
Being helpful also builds alot of positive connections which is very important in keeping high morale in a workplace.

#### Patient
Petience is something that is being learned by being calm and collective in stresfull situations.
Practicing meditation helped me achieve that. 
It also helps alot in understanding whats important in life but also in code.

#### Dedicated and determined
When a task is given to me I take pride in completing it.
I think highly about my capabilities and it makes me determined to prove to myself that I can do it.
Whether its working in a team to complete a big project or working on something small just by myself I always make sure its done.
